## Why nier_live_wallpaper
Recently I found that Lively Wallpaper can use shaders. So I decided to try to replecate (lol) one interesting live wallpaper I found online so I could use it on different resolutions and have much more control of any effects. 
This wallpaper doesn't have anything to clearly indicate that it's about Nier, but still evokes strange feelings. 

## How to use wallpaper
This wallpaper was made and tested to work with [Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively?ysclid=m4489zp8k1784699613). Just download zip file in releases and drag into Lively Wallpaper! Should work.

## I'M NOT THE AUTHOR OF IDEA
As I mentioned I found that wallpaper accidentally online but coudn't find it's author. Thus I didn't draw any textures (just modified them).
If you are the creator of video below or general idea, please accept my admiration and thank you!

## TODO
My version still far from original and much more far of what I want to do.

- water surface reflection is not good enough
- thing on hilt of the sword have to be dinamyc
- add glare on the sword
- add hens flare
- fix texture artifacts (strange black contour)
- change settings for Live Wallpaper
- definetly need to optimize

Also I want to use mouce position to simulate wind for particles... Or something like that.
